Homepage and documentation source for the Ansible
=================================================

This project hosts the source behind [ansible.cc/docs](http://ansible.cc/docs)

Contributions to the documentation are welcome.  To make changes, submit a pull request
that changes the restructured text files in the "rst/" directory only, and Michael can
do a docs build and push the static files.

If you do not want to learn RST format (ReStructured Text), you can also file issues
on the documentation project.
