NAME

ansible - run a command somewhere else


SYNOPSIS
--------
ansible [-H hosts_path] [-L library_path] [-f forks] [-n module_name]
        [-a [args1 [args2 ...]]] [-p host_pattern] [-u remote_user]


DESCRIPTION
-----------

*Ansible* is an extra-simple Python API for doing \'remote things' over
SSH.


OPTIONS
-------

*-P*, *--askpass*::

Ask the user to input the ssh password for connecting.


*-H*, *--host-list*::

Path to hosts list.


*-L*, *--library*::

Path to module library.


*-f*, *--forks*::

Level of parallelism. Specify as an integer.


*-n*, *--name*::

Module name to execute.


*-a*, *--args*::

Arguments to module.


*-p*, *--pattern*::

Hostname pattern. Accepts shell-like globs.


*-r*, *--run-playbook*::

*-u*, *--remote-user*::

Remote user to connect as. Uses __root__ by default.


INVENTORY
---------

Ansible stores the hosts it can potentially operate on in an inventory
file. The syntax is simple: one host per line. Organize your hosts
into multiple groups by separating them into multiple inventory files.


FILES
-----

/etc/ansible/hosts -- Default hosts file

/usr/share/ansible -- Default module library
