TODO list and plans
===================

   * make remote user settable versus assuming remote login is named root
   * modules for users, groups, and files, using puppet style ensure mechanics
   * ansible-inventory -- gathering fact/hw info, storing in git, adding RSS
   * ansible-slurp ------ recursively rsync file trees for each host
   * very simple option constructing/parsing for modules
   * Dead-simple declarative configuration management engine using
     a runbook style recipe file, written in JSON or YAML
   * maybe it's own fact engine, not required, that also feeds from facter
   * add/remove/list hosts from the command line
   * list available modules from command line
   * filter exclusion (run this only if fact is true/false)
